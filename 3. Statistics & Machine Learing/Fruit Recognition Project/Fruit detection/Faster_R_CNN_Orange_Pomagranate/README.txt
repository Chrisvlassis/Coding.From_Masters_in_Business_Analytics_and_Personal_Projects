In this file we have a jupyter notebook which contains the code for the object detection system capable of identifying and locating fruits, specifically lemons and bananas, in images. The model aims to draw bounding boxes around the detected objects and classify them into one of two classes: 'Orange' and 'Pomagranate'.
