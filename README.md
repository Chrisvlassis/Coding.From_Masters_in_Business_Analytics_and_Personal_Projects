# Master-in-Business-Analytics and Personal Projects
In this repository, we find the most important projects (not all of them since the total number is about 25 projects) that were made during the Masters in Business Analytics. Also, we find the most important Personal Projects Their main focuses are data engineering, data management, software engineering, data analysis, statistics & ML, business processes.

For convenience we have created 4 main folders. Each folder is focused in one of the following subjects:
1. Data Engineering
2. Software Engineering
3. Statistics & Machine Learing
4. Data Analysis & Visualization
5. Other important projects (algorythms & Business Processes)

Also, for each project, there is a small file that contains a summary about the main goal of the project(not the solution). 

#### Note: Some of the projects may not contain the questions or the data. This is due to the fact that some of the questions were posted in platforms (which are now closed) and for the data they might were very large to import them in Gitgub.
