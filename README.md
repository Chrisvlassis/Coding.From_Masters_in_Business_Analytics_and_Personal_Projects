# Master-in-Business-Analytics
In this repository, we find the most important projects (not all of them since the total number is about 25 projects) that were made in the Masters in Business Analytics. Their main focuses are data engineering, data management, data analysis, statistics & ML and business processes.

For convenience we have created 4 main folders. Each folder is focused in one of the following subjects:
1. Data Engineering
2. Data Analysis & Visualization
3. Statistics & Machine Learing
4. Other important projects (algorythms & Business Processes)

Also, for each project, there is a small file that contains a summary about the main goal of the project(not the solution). 

#### Note: Some of the projects maybe do not contain the questions or the data. This is because some of the questions were posted in platforms (which is now closed) and for the data they might were very large to import them in Gitgub.
